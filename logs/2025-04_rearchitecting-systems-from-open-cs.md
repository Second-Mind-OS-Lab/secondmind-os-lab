## 📍 Context

Open CS curriculums (`MIT`, `Harvard`, `Stanford`) offer deep, structured system insights — but often stay abstract.  
This log traces how they were reframed and repurposed directly into runtime product infra decisions.

## 🧱 System Trace

→ [2025-04-04] Runtime Decisions (Infra/API/Latency)  
→ [2025-04-07] Public Reflection (Medium)

## 🔧 Core System Loop

- Iterative system framing across multiple CS paradigms
- Internal loops focused on reconciling latency tradeoffs, infra composition, and modular scalability
- Structured reflection via layered feedback cycles (learning → mapping → infra shaping)

## 🛠️ Infra Outcomes

This log traces how primitives from MIT OS and Harvard CS50 were translated into [Nebula Dev Studio](https://github.com/nebuladstudio)’s early infra:

| Concept                      | Product Reflection                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `OS kernels`                 | Latency pattern design in runtime API |
| `CS50 test scaffolds`        | Internal API validation schema        |
| `Queue architecture`         | SQS + async Celery job runners        |
| `Compute/storage separation` | ECS + Terraform config templates      |

## 📤 Output

## 🧭 Notes & Future Trace Seeds

- This public log is structured for other founders/teams to fork and adapt structured learning into build-ready insight.
- Internal system traces and debugging layers are kept within the private Notion logs.
- Reflections here abstract away internal system tracebacks and architectural pivots.
- Feedback loops (internal & external) were crucial in evolving raw learning into executable infra.
- Full trace available in private Notion log (includes layer-specific iterations, thought stack re-maps, infra deltas).

## 🔗 Internal Reference

- **📓 Notion Log (private, request-only)**  
  ↳ Title: [“Second Mind OS Log – 2025-04 – Open CS Integration”](https://secondmindlab.notion.site/2025-04_rearchitecting-systems-from-open-cs-md-1d4af5f3c08f80d7b200c0f6116a5813)  
  ↳ Includes full internal debug session, infra diagrams, and cross-layer mapping graphs.

> Logs evolve. So do systems._
