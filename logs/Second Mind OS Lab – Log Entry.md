## 📍 Context

Brief intro (2-5 lines) on why this loop/log happened.  
Should set the stage: what was abstract, what was missing, what triggered the dive?

## 🧱 System Trace

Mermaid diagram
Example:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Foundations]
    B[System Mapping Loop]
    C[Runtime Decisions]
    D[Public Reflection]

    A --> B --> C --> D
```

```txt
[High-level trace of flow]
Example:
Input (CS/Infra/Reflection)
→ Feedback Loop
→ Runtime Infra Shaping
→ External Output (Post/Product/Decision)
```

## 🔧 Core System Loop

- What were the core thought loops / learning cycles?
- How did they compound? Across what frameworks / references?
- What was reframed, restructured, or internalized differently?

## 🛠️ Infra / Conceptual Outcomes

If relevant, include tangible reflections or mappings:  
| Concept / Insight | Reflection / Application |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Concept 1` | How it reflected in system/product |
| `Pattern` | What was done with it? Why? |

## 📤 Output

List clearly where this trace loop surfaced into tangible output (if any):

  ↳ Layer: [Personal/Studio]  
  ↳ Context: [Blog post, internal diagram, shipped infra, etc.]

## 🧭 Notes & Future Trace Seeds

- What might be forked or abstracted for future loops?
- What was left unresolved / open-ended for next iterations?
- Any intentional design tensions that were left active?
