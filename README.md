# Second Mind OS Lab

> A public R&D interface for builders designing internal developer systems, mental scaffolds, and backend execution models.
>
> This repo is the **modular, forkable layer** of the Second Mind OS Lab — the deep system design lab powering [Nebula Dev Studio](https://github.com/nebuladstudio).

## 🧬 Overview

**Second Mind OS Lab** is a systems-first R&D lab focused on designing internal platforms, mental models, and scalable backend architectures.

We don't just build code — we design **execution systems**:

- 🧩 Developer OS blueprints
- 🛠️ Internal scaffolds & delivery frameworks
- 🧠 Decision layers & clarity tools

🔗 Core thinking and deep logics live in Notion (lab journal):  
→ [secondmind.notion.site/lab](https://secondmindlab.notion.site/Second-Mind-OS-Lab-1c5af5f3c08f8095a236d220035b5b49)

This repo is the **public-facing interface** — optimized for reuse, scaling, and open knowledge sharing.

## 🔭 Purpose

> Build a modular Thinking OS for engineers — to think clearly, build systematically, and scale effortlessly.

## 🧩 Lab Structure

```
📁 /logs → Public build logs (recaps, outcomes, patterns)
📁 /blueprints → System design templates & reusable thinking scaffolds
📁 /experiments → Technical sketches, infra trials, execution prototypes
📁 /references → Curated notes from systems research & CS theory
📁 /meta → Roadmap, vision shifts, Lab evolution notes
```

## 🛠️ Tech & Thinking Stack

- **System Design** — Execution architectures, decision-first platforms
- **Cognitive Engineering** — Mental compression, modeling clarity
- **Dev Infra** — Internal tooling, scalable pipelines, delivery scaffolds
- **Cloud Infra** — Terraform, K8s, Serverless, distributed queues

## 🧬 Core Belief

> We build not just to ship faster — but to **think better**.
> Clarity and speed are outcomes of sharp systems, not just better tools.
